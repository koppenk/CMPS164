CMPS 164 Game Engine Final Project

This is our final project, including minigolf and Bocce!

The minigolf game includes a full profiling and high-scoring system. 

The bocce game is 2-player, and allows one round of play. 
Player 1 throws the Palino and the game continues from there.

We have hard-coded the course filenames for ease of running. If you need to test a different golf course, name it "course.db" and place it in the same folder as the executable. 

Enjoooooooooy!!
