This is our final project, including minigolf and Bocce!

The minigolf game includes a full profiling and high-scoring system. 

The bocce game is 2-player, and allows one round of play. 
Player 1 throws the Palino and the game continues from there.

Select 1-player to play against our AI system! It's rudimentary, and functions by randomly simulating a number of possible shots.

We have hard-coded the course filenames for ease of running. If you need to test a different golf course, name it "course.db" and place it in the same folder as the executable. 

If you beat the minigolf, the high scores window will be shown. If you've made the cut, your profile name will be added to the list!

Enjoooooooooy!!
